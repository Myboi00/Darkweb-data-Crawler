# Darkweb-data-Crawler
"Tor-Enabled Onion Website Scraper with Keyword Analysis" is a Python tool that scrapes .onion websites via the Tor network. It searches for keywords, analyzes content, and saves results in Excel. Unlike standard crawlers, it accesses hidden services, providing anonymity and deeper web exploration with keyword-based analysis.
